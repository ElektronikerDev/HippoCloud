# Hippo-Cloud

The HippoCloud is an open source project by Thomas Michaelis <@Elektroniker>.
The cloud enables server management across multiple Linux / Windows / macOS servers. Cloud communication is based on [RabbitMQ](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server).

**WARNING:** Due to the time in which the project has not been maintained, there are partly fatal security vulnerabilities by external libraries in the project.
So also the **Log4J security vulnerability!**
